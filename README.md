This is a clock made in javascript using async functions for a better flow of the code, the logic of the clock does not rely in css as most of the javascript clocks (for shifting the hours) but in javascript which gives it functionality and dynamicity, from this project I learned how to use async functions and how setInterval() is used and how to rely logic in javascript.
